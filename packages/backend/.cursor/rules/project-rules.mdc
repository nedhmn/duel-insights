- Don't add comments to the top of python files
- All http requests should be done with the httpx library
- Make tests minimal
- Python functions, class, methods, etc. documentation should just be a one line comment, not multilines
- When setting types, use `| None` instead of `Optional` from the typing library.
- Don't import `Dict` or `List` from typing, you can use the base `dict` and `list` instead
